Tutorial Step 1:
1. User profile
  a. This is your wallet! Each new user starts with $100,000. Your wallet contains: 1. A list of all the currencies that you currently own and their quantities, 2. The current exchange rates for those currencies in USD, 3. The value of each currency in current USD, and 4. The total value of your wallet, which is reported to the leaderboard.
2. How to buy/sell currency
  a. This is the buy page! This shows a list of all the currencies that you can purchase with USD, and it also shows how the exchange rates have changed over time. You can buy any currency you want with the USD in your wallet, and try to grow your account over time.
3. How to sell currency
  a. This is the sell page! This shows a list of all of the currencies that you can sell for USD, and it also shows how the exchange rates have changed over time. Currently, you can only convert sell your currencies for USD.
4. History page.
  a. This is the history page. You can see a list of all the transactions that you've made during the last 30 days here. There are no transaction fees, so if you mistakenly buy/sell the wrong currency, then it's easy to fix your mistake with no penalty!
5. Show currency price change over time
  a. Exchange rates update daily at midnight PST. But let's simulate a price change for this tutorial! You currently have 1000 USD, and 100,000 YEN worth 766.92 USD in his wallet. Your wallet total is $1,858.92. Click this button to simulate one day of price changes. The YEN exchange rate has increased/decreased from X to Y. Your YEN has increased/decreased in value by XXX, and the total value of your wallet has increased/decreased by XXX to Z.
6. Show leaderboards
  a. These are the leaderboards. You can compete with your peers! On this page you can see how much money the top users have in their wallet, as well as the top 2 currencies that are currently held in their wallet. So if you don't know which currencies to start buying, then you can look at the leaderboard for tips.
